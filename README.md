# RPX

**A simple way to write RPC Clients and Servers in Elixir**

RPX allows you to easily define your RPC Servers and call its functions from a Client. Currently AMQP is the only supported connection protocol, but others might be implemented as well. The next goal of this library is to create a DSL to make Servers definition more straightforward.
